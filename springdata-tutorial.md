# Spring Data

<https://spring.io/projects/spring-data>

> Spring Dataâ€™s mission is to **provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model** for **data access** while still **retaining the special traits of the underlying data store**.
>
> It makes it easy to use data access technologies, **relational and non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud-based data services**. This is an umbrella project which contains many subprojects that are specific to a given database. The projects are developed by working together with many of the companies and developers that are behind these exciting technologies.
